# Vinyl Tracker

## Overview
For my project, I chose to create a vinyl tracking application.

The world of vinyl is a truly tech free, meaning you cannot store your records online. You have the tangible collection. This app is designed to help you manage your collection.

If you are at a bar and want to show someone your collection, you can't just show them a spotify playlist, but now, you can show them your Vinyl Tracker!
